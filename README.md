We encountered a problem. The lack of solutions for people who, due to their event being postponed, are no longer able to attend the event.
With that in mind, we thought of a solution that doesn't have to deal with bureaucracies that money involves. That solution is trading.
Our app is a safe market place, to swipe for tickets in a tinder like fashion, and tap when you find the one that is the perfect candidate 
to offer a proposal for trade with one of your tickets. The user will be notified with your proposal and accept it if he likes it, 
decline or make a counter-proposal.
The possibilities are endless. You can make friends, and meet people with the same tastes as you. 
Being tied to a ticket is so 2019, you no longer have to regret a purchase, or have a ticket just for show to an event that you can´t go. 
Just trade it for something that you do want, and that you are going to use. 
The Show Must Go On
